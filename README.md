# Library Management System

This system is targeted to help the librarians by providing a GUI based system for managing the tasks that they need to carry on the daily basis. LMS allows librarians to issue books to borrowers, check in the returned books, add new borrowers and manage fines for overdue book loans.

It is implemented as a Node.js application with MySQL database server and uses jQuery, express.js, HTML, bootstrap etc.
